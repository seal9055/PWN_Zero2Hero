Name: Coffee Maker
Description: Our coworker just bought an iot coffee machine that lets him start the brewing process
             from his computer. Hacking it and messing with his coffee seems like a fun prank. We 
             were able to extract the compressed firmware the encoder/compressor. Can you retrieve
             the original firmware and write an exploit for the firmware? I'm sure its vulnerable, 
             it probably doesn't even have stack protectors or pie.

             According to the manufacturers website the md5sum of the original firmware is:
		29f01db82591575454dd6e36a87c397f

For admins:
	to start challenge, setup docker using commands commented at top of Dockerfile. Distribute files in `static` to user
